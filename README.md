 Design Choices and Libraries

The design prioritizes clarity and user experience within the time constraints. Let's delve into the technologies used:

* **Next.js with TypeScript:** This powerful combination offers performance benefits (including static site generation) and strong typing for a robust development experience.
* **CSS Modules:** This approach ensures clean and maintainable styling by scoping styles to individual components.
* **Framer Motion:** Smooth and engaging animations are integrated throughout the page using Framer Motion, enhancing user interaction.
* **React Icons:** A comprehensive icon library is readily available through React Icons, adding visual interest to the content.
